> [!NOTE]
> We believe in shipping early and often.
> Now that **we're using co(lab) to build all of Blackboard's projects internally including Electrobun and co(lab) itself** we decided to open source it and make the Developer Preview available for download for early feedback.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Some of the listed features are in early development**, and our FTU and onboarding could use some love.
> We invite the **brave** to download the developer preview as we prep for v1 and **give us feedback** on how co(lab) could best help you do your best deep work


# Co(lab)

A hybrid web browser + local code editor for deep work.

**Co(lab)** combines a powerful code editor with an integrated browser. At Blackboard Technologies we think about startups night and day. Co(lab) is our flagship product, built with [Electrobun](https://github.com/blackboardsh/electrobun), and we hope to make it the ultimate startup building environment.

## Features

- **Unified Development Environment**: Local code editor powered by Monaco and Bun combined with a tinkerer's web browser in the same window, multi-tab, multi-pane.
- **Web Browser**: Open Chromium or Webkit tabs. Isolate your online accounts in their own workspaces. Smart bookmarks and easy to edit preload scripts for customizing your browsing experience.
- **A new way to folder**: Files and Folders are a primary concept. Arrange projects, notes, git repos, and bookmarks the way you actually use them.
- **Git Integration**: Visual git interface with staging, commits, and branch management
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for custom functionality for the ultimate browsing, coding, and tightly integrated workflows.
- **Privacy-First Analytics**: Optional, opt-in analytics.
